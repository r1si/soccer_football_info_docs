# About API

SoccerFootball.info is an advanced soccer API service; robust, high-performing and with reviewed and reliable data.

We have been collecting data since 2017 in a robust and secure environment. We have been using internally collected data for processing. And in 2021, we decided to open our giant DB to the public! 

Currently our DB is composed of more than 1.5 billion of data  ðŸ“ˆðŸ“ˆðŸ“ˆ

## Source of data

The data are retrieved directly from Unibet's source and aggregated with those of bet365 as they are more complete.
